# time-based trends

- time-series plot showing accident frequency over time, and maybe how this changes year to year 
- bar chart showing what time of day the most accidents occur
- bar chart showing whether or not accidents occur more frequently on certain days of the week, day of the month, month of the year, etc
- not sure what kind of chart, but determine whether accident frequency/severity is impacted by holidays

# geographic-based trends

- a heatmap showing which states have the most accidents
- for the best/worst states, determine whether environmental factors have an impact
- weather vs road conditions severity ?
